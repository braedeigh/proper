      <h1>Welcome to the Proper Consumer Map!</h1>

    <div class="card">
      <p>
        Proper is a transparency-forward consumer resource for everyday essentials. On the Proper Consumer Map, you will find items that are I have deemed to be the most sustainable product for each category based on extensive research.
        Each product card links to a supply chain map or summary and list of known information
        about each product, so you can see where your clothing and hygiene items
        come from and what they are truly made of.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here you will find my research on household items that are the most
        transparently sourced or sustainable. My goal is to map the supply chains
        of every item that I use, starting with clothing and hygiene products.
      </p>
      <p>
        For items that I cannot acquire the information to create a comprehensive
        map of the supply chain, I will research the public aspects of that product
        to determine the “best” item in each category, ranked on sustainability,
        health, and other factors that I am curating.
      </p>
      <p>
        I aim to create the "Proper Standard" which is a consumer label indicating that the entire supply chain of an item is transparently available to consumers. In an effort to combat greenwashing and poor labor standards, I aim to curate a list of items that are ranked from most to least transparently sourced, with only items with all nodes of their supply chain containing contact information earn their title as Proper Standard. However, I will also be providing best alternatives in cases where this is impossible, and aim to showcase and reward brands that are working towards total supply chain transparency.
