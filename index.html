      <h1>Welcome to the Proper Consumer Map!</h1>

    <div class="card">
      <p>
        Proper is a transparency-forward consumer resource for everyday essentials. On the Proper Consumer Map, you will find items that are I have deemed to be the "best" product for each category based on extensive research. The criteria I judge each item off of will be based primarily on supply chain transparency, sustainability, and health.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here you will find my research on household items that I have decided to use in my daily life based off of these criteria. My goal is to map the supply chains
        of every item that I use to high granularity, starting with clothing and hygiene products. Each product card links to a supply chain map or summary and list of known information about each product, so you can see where your clothing and hygiene items
        come from, what they are truly made of, and whether it is the most healthful choice.
      </p>
      <p>
        For items that I cannot acquire the information to create a comprehensive
        map of the supply chain, I will research the public aspects of that product
        to determine the “best” item in each category ranked on the factors I am curating.
      </p>
      <p>
        I aim to create the "Proper Standard" which is a consumer label indicating that the entire supply chain of an item is transparently available to consumers. In an effort to combat greenwashing and poor labor standards, I aim to curate a list of items that are ranked from most to least transparently sourced, with only items with all nodes of their supply chain containing contact information earn their title as Proper Standard. This will be a tiered ranking system; in order to meet minimum Proper Standard a product must provide all contact information for all nodes in the supply chain required to produce an object, i will personally embody and perform what I believe to be the highest form of transparency possible, which is posting the majority of my spending habits with all available information about what supply chains are supported by my daily life.
           </p>
   <p>      
However, I will also be providing best alternatives in cases where this is impossible, and aim to showcase and reward brands that are working towards total supply chain transparency, sustainability, and human health.
      </p>
      <p> 
        My overarching goal with this project is to calculate my way out of an extractive lifestyle so that all of my daily habits create a net "regenerative" lifestyle. This means that all supply chains that I support create a net decrease in carbon in the atmosphere, supports ecosystems that support increased biodiversity and will not deplete the soils and resources that support them, and create a supply chain for my future family that I know will last us for generations to come. More details to come. If you would like to support me, please reach out to my email, bradie.lee33@gmail.com.
