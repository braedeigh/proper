  <h1>Welcome to the Proper Consumer Map!</h1>
  <p>
    Proper is a transparency-first marketplace for everyday essentials. Each product links to a supply chain map or list of known information about each product, so you can see where your clothing and hygiene items truly come from and what they are made of. Visibility is the standard. 
    
    Here you will find my research on household items that are the most transparently sourced or sustainable. My goal is to map the supply chains of every item that I use, starting with clothing and hygeine products. For items that I cannot acquire the information to create a comprehensive map of the supply chain, I will research the public aspects of that product to determine the "best" item in each category, ranked on sustainability, health, and other factors that I am curating. </p>
